## Computing in algebraic combinatorics
I'm a mathematician at the [Ohio State University](https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/), working mainly in algebraic geometry and combinatorics.

Some code for computing Schubert polynomials and variations can be found at my [github](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/).

Here is my [first experiment](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/ml-lrc#ml-lrc--ml-for-littlewood-richardson-numbers) in ML.

Here is a widget for drawing [bumpless pipe dreams](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/bpds#bpds).
