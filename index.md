## Computing in algebraic combinatorics

I'm a mathematician at the [Ohio State University](https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/), working mainly in algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
  
Some code for computing Schubert polynomials and variations can be found at my [github](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/).

Here is the [SchubertPolynomials](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/SchubertPolynomials.jl#schubertpolynomials) Julia package.

Here is my [first experiment](./ml-lrc.md) in ML.

Here is a widget for drawing [bumpless pipe dreams](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/bpds#bpds).
