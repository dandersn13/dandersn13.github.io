## Computing in algebraic combinatorics

I'm a mathematician at the [Ohio State University](https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/), working mainly in algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
  
Some code for computing Schubert polynomials and variations can be found at my [github](https://github.com/pseudoeffective/).

Here is my [first experiment](./ml-lrc.md) in ML.

I'll have some more experiments and code posted soon!
