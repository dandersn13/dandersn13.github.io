## Computing in algebraic combinatorics
<p>I'm a mathematician at the <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/">Ohio State University</a>, working mainly in algebraic geometry and combinatorics.</p>
<p>Some code for computing Schubert polynomials and variations can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/dandersn13/">github</a>.</p>
<p>Here is my [first experiment](./ml-lrc.md) in ML.</p>
<p>I'll have some more experiments and code posted soon!</p>
